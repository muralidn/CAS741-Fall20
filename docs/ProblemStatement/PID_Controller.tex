\section*{Problem Statement}

A Closed Loop control system can be defined as the system where the input to the Power Plant is continuously 
adjusted by monitoring the feedback from the Power Plant until the expected Set-Point is reached. The 
Closed Loop control is used in a variety of applications such as cruise control of an automobile, temperature 
control in a thermostat, and many more. The heart of the control loop is the Proportional, Integral, Derivative 
(PID) controller which drives the input to the Power Plant in the loop. However, the PID controller in a loop must 
be tuned before it is deemed ready for use. This involves setting optimal values for the respective Proportional, 
Integral and Derivative gain constants. Therefore, a model is necessary to simulate the inputs and outputs of a 
control loop with which the PID gains can be tuned.

The inputs to the model are the Set-Point(numeric),  Proportional Gain(numeric), Integral Gain(numeric), Derivative
Gain(numeric), total simulation time (numeric) and step time(numeric). The outputs from the model are the Measured Values
from the Power Plant(numeric list) and time-points (numeric list).
